# 🛡️ Ajax Alarm System Integration for Home Assistant

Integrate your **Ajax Security System** seamlessly with **Home Assistant** — control, automate, and monitor your alarm system directly from your smart home dashboard.

---

## ⚠️ Secure Your Home Assistant Installation First!

Before installing this integration, **please make sure your Home Assistant instance is properly secured**.
Following best practices will protect both your home network and your Ajax account.

### 🧱 Security Best Practices

- 🔑 Use a **strong and unique username and password**.
- 🔒 Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for your Home Assistant account.
- 🚫 **Do not expose** Home Assistant directly to the internet using the default port.
  Instead, consider one (or combine several) of the following:
  - 🌀 **Reverse Proxy** (e.g., Nginx, Traefik)
  - ☁️ **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** such as [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
  - 🔐 **Private VPN** access only

### 👤 Dedicated Account for Ajax
- Avoid using your **admin** account for this integration.
- Create a **dedicated Ajax account** with **minimal permissions** (usually only ability to arm night mode is enough).
- Configure **network access restrictions** — only allow connections from trusted networks.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.6+**
- HACS installed
- Ajax account with limited permissions
- Internet access for Ajax API connectivity

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Switch `turn_on` / `turn_off`** | 🔴 Not implemented | Relay / WallSwitch control not yet available |
| **Siren control (`turn_on` / `turn_off`)** | 🔴 Not implemented | Alarm state is monitored; manual trigger not supported |
| **Night mode bypass malfunctions** | ℹ️ Hub-side behavior | The hub may arm bypassing active malfunctions — this is normal Ajax behaviour |
| **Real-time push events** | 🟡 Polling only | State is refreshed every 30s (disarmed) or 60s (armed) |
| **Groups / partitions** | 🔴 Not implemented | All zones are treated as a single partition |
| **Arm / Disarm timeout** | ℹ️ Max 60s | If the server is unreachable for >60s, the command fails with an explicit error — check hub status in the Ajax app |

  - Auto-arming when everyone leaves home.
  - Disarming when you arrive via geolocation.
  - Sending Telegram or mobile alerts on alarm triggers.
  - Alerting when battery drops below a threshold on any sensor.
  - Sending a notification if any device goes offline.

## 📋 Changelog

### v0.5.1 — Bug Fixes

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Signal Level sensor** — now returns a human-readable label (`NO_SIGNAL` / `WEAK` / `NORMAL` / `STRONG`) instead of a raw numeric value (0–4). The sensor uses the HA `ENUM` device class for proper state display and translation.
- **Arm / Disarm / Night mode timeout** — retry window extended to 60 attempts × 1s (60s total). On timeout, a clear error is logged: *"command timed out — the Ajax server did not confirm the operation after 60 attempts. Please verify the hub status in the Ajax app and try again."*
- **Setup retry timing** — integration setup retries are now aligned to 1s intervals (60 attempts max), consistent with arm command behaviour.

---

### v0.5.0 — Reliability & Device Attributes

#### 🟢 New Entities
- **Hub Battery sensor** — exposes the hub's internal backup battery percentage, charge state (`CHARGED`, `CHARGING`, `DISCHARGING`), external power status and charging mode. Appears as a diagnostic sensor on the hub device card.
- **HomeSiren / StreetSiren support** — sirens now have a dedicated `Alarm` binary sensor (active during triggered states) with siren-specific attributes: `alarm_duration`, `siren_volume_level`, `beep_volume_level`, `post_alarm_indication_mode`, `chimes_enabled`, and more.

#### 🟠 Improved Reliability
- **Arm / Disarm / Night mode auto-retry** — commands now automatically retry up to 50 times (500ms between attempts) when the server is temporarily rate-limited or unavailable. No user action required — HA will confirm the state change once the server accepts the command.
- **Setup retry on rate limit** — if the Ajax server rate-limits requests during integration startup (common with many devices), the setup now waits and retries automatically instead of failing and requiring a manual restart.
- **Rate limit detection** — the integration now correctly detects both HTTP 429 responses and the Ajax server's `"exceeded the limit"` message body, which is returned as HTTP 200 in some cases.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Hub firmware version** — the `Firmware` sensor and hub device card now correctly show the firmware version string (e.g. `2.36.123`) instead of the raw API object.
- **Hub model** — the hub device card now shows the actual model identifier from the API (e.g. `HUB_2`) instead of the generic label `Hub`.

#### 🟡 More Device Attributes
All device binary sensors expose 17 additional attributes from the Ajax API, including arming delays (`arm_delay_seconds`, `alarm_delay_seconds`, night mode variants), alarm confirmation flags (`confirms_alarm`, `verifies_alarm`), and device metadata (`group_id`, `room_id`, `color`, `capabilities`, `siren_triggers`, `indicator_light_mode`).

### v0.4.2 — Code Quality & Documentation

- Translated all internal comments and log messages to English throughout the codebase
- Removed development artefacts (commented-out debug code, internal annotation tags)
- No functional changes — full backwards compatibility maintained

---

### v0.4.1 — Improved Arm/Disarm Reliability

#### 🔴 Bug Fixes
- Fixed error handling during arm, disarm, and night mode operations — transient server errors no longer cause unhandled exceptions in HA logs

#### 🟡 Improvements
- Malfunction warning: a log warning is now emitted when an arm command is issued while the hub reports active malfunctions or arm prevention conditions (the hub may arm with bypass anyway — this is normal Ajax behaviour)

---

### v0.4.0 — Security & Stability Update

#### 🔴 Security Fixes
- Password is now transmitted as a **SHA256 hash** — it was previously sent in plaintext
- Added request timeout on token refresh — prevents coordinator freeze on unresponsive server

#### 🟠 Robustness
- Entities maintain last known state during transient API errors — no false "unavailable" transitions
- Improved authentication stability — tolerates transient errors before triggering re-authentication
- **Adaptive polling**: 30s when disarmed, 60s when armed — reduces API load by ~50% when armed
- Client-side rate limiting prevents HTTP 429 on accounts with many devices
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff on transient network errors

#### 🟠 Code Quality
- Entity naming now follows HA guidelines (`"Device · Sensor"` format) — ⚠️ **Breaking change**: friendly names will change for existing entities
- `DeviceInfo` updated to typed struct with corrected manufacturer name (`"Ajax Systems"`)

#### 🟡 Features
- Added UI translations (English, Italian)
- Post-setup options flow: adjust polling intervals without reconfiguring the integration
- HA Diagnostics support: export anonymized debug data via the HA diagnostics UI

---

### v0.3.1 — Authentication & Stability Fixes

- Fixed false re-authentication prompts caused by concurrent token refresh across multiple coordinators
- Fixed startup failure when hub has no devices configured
- Fixed rate-limit responses incorrectly treated as authentication failures
- Fixed startup error handling — HA now shows "Not ready / retrying" instead of a misleading re-auth dialog
- Fixed config flow: added timeout, resolved duplicate entry creation, improved reauth dialog clarity
- Fixed device class warning for transmitter/multitransmitter devices on startup

---

### v0.3.0 — Coordinator Architecture

- Introduced shared `DataUpdateCoordinator` — one API call per device/hub per cycle, shared across all entities
- All entities use `CoordinatorEntity` — automatic `unavailable` state on API failure
- Arm/disarm commands now trigger an immediate coordinator refresh

---

### v0.2.0

- Added signal strength and firmware sensors for all devices
- Added hub companion sensors: Firmware, Alarm As Malfunction Arming, Arm Prevention Conditions
- Added hub companion binary sensors: Tamper, Problem
- Full hub `extra_state_attributes` from real API discovery

---

### v0.1.x

- Initial release: alarm panel, device binary sensors (opening, motion, smoke, moisture)
- Companion diagnostics: battery, tamper, connectivity, problem per device
- Device-specific attributes from real API discovery (DoorProtect, MotionProtect, LeaksProtect, FireProtect)
